/**
 * Utility class for doing local->window transformations for case where Canvas3D
 * is a simple display such as a monitor. This won't work for the more complex
 * cases (i.e. a multiple canvases, head tracking, etc).
 * 
 * Usage: // after the canvas and node are created LocalToWindow locToWindow =
 * LocalToWindow(node, canvas); ... // when we need to transform (canvas
 * location and node transforms may have // changed) locToWindow.update(); //
 * make sure transforms are up to date
 * 
 * Point3d[] localPts = <some local coords to transform > Point[] windowPts =
 * <the area to put the tranformed pts > for (int i = 0; i < localPts.length;
 * i++) { locToWindow.transformPt(localPts[i], windowPts[i]); }
